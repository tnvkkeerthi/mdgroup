This application uses [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) to load environment variables. If NODE_ENV is local or test, environment variables are loaded from `config/.local` and `config/.test` files relatively.

It also uses [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) driver for mongodb, [signale-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/signale-logger) for logging and [swagger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express) for API documentation.
